# Philosophy

## User Interface

### Open Access

As much data as ethically and legally possible should be open access, providing unrestricted access to everything that does not contain any personal or sensitive data.  

This will make the site maximally usable and attractive for casual browsing, external linking, and discovery.
At the same time, we must respect the wishes of the researchers as well as the participants.

### Minimal Interrogation

Encourage users to provide as much data as possible by making all data entry processes streamlined and flexible: all fields are optional.  

Metadata and object relationships should be derived from existing, available sources as much as possible, without burdening the researcher with excessive constraints.
While we want to allow advanced users to supply as much structure and detail as they would like, much of this collection should happen as a natural part of interaction with the site.

### Robustness

Code should be portable, defensive, accessible, and degrade gracefully.
Websites should never require specific browsers or enabled features.  

Follow good web design practices.
Don't make assumptions about platforms, cookies, plugins, or user agents.
Use unobtrusive JavaScript and follow open standards whenever possible.
