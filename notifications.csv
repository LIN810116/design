[Your authorization allows you to access all the shared data in Databrary. Our primary goal is to inspire you to reuse shared videos on Databrary to ask new questions outside the scope of the original study. You will also find illustrative video excerpts that you can use for teaching and to learn about researchers' methods and procedures.
[Databrary's unique ""active curation"" functionality allows you to upload your videos as you collect them so that your data are backed up and preserved in our free, secure library, your videos are immediately available to you and your collaborators offsite, and your data are organized and ready for sharing.  Your data will remain private and accessible only to your lab members and collaborators until you are ready to share with the Databrary community.  When you are ready, sharing is as easy as clicking a button!
To share your data, you can use our template Databrary release form for obtaining permission for sharing from your participants, which can be found here: http://databrary.org/access/policies/release-template.html The release form can be added to new or existing IRB protocols. It is completely adaptable and can be customized to suit your needs. We also have lots of information and helpful tips about managing and sharing your video data in our User Guide: http://databrary.org/access/guide As soon as your protocol is amended to allow you to share data, you can start uploading your data from each new session. Don't wait until your study is complete to upload your videos. It's much easier to upload data after each data collection while your study is in progress!]
We are dedicated to providing assistance to the Databrary community. Please contact us at support@databrary.org with questions or for help getting started.]"
