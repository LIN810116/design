# Registration

Databrary hosts sensitive, identifiable research participant information (e.g., videos, ages) which has only selectively been released to "authorized researchers who agree to maintain confidentiality."
Therefore, in addition to establishing identity and credentials, we require users to register on the site in order to enter and begin establishing the trust relationships necessary for Databrary to operate ethically.
This requires:

- Providing and encouraging users to understand the implications of the Databrary [investigator agreement](http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.html).
- Users verify their provided email address.
- Users providing information about who (the institution or sponsoring researcher) will vouch for their access.

Currently, the registration wizard walks users through these steps in this order.

# Splash

Once users are registered, we want to highlight the progress already made on the site.
Primarily this means showing off other researchers who have already joined and possibly contributed data.
Currently the library only includes data from a small number of researchers.
However, the purpose of the release we're previewing here (to happen later this month) is to solicit contributions of small abouts of representative data from a variety of researchers (targeting 100).
Therefore, we expect the most flattering aspect of the site to be these researchers themselves.

# Volume

The basic unit of data on Databrary is known (at least internally) as volume, which can externally represent a dataset (raw, unanalyzed data collected for research) or a study (reflecting a research product, such as a publication).
In addition to all of the raw, participant- and session-level videos, files, and metadata (which we will not discuss in this first meeting), volumes include the following "top-level" metadata:

- Title: for studies usually the same as the paper title, otherwise a descriptive summary
- Description: for studies usually the same as the paper abstract, otherwise a longer description of acquisition methods, tasks, collection approach, etc.
- Citations: publications or other references based on or associated with data in the volume
- Funding sources: agencies funding data collection and/or research, and grant numbers
- Access controls: permission levels for the entire volume, for sharing with the public, with only Databrary, with an entire research lab, or with specific collaborators
