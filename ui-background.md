# Registration

Databrary hosts sensitive, identifiable data on research participants (e.g., videos, ages). 
This data is selectively released to "authorized researchers who agree to maintain confidentiality."
We therefore not only require users to register with the site, but also to establish their identity and credentials in order to establish the trust necessary for Databrary to operate ethically.
This requires:

- Providing and encouraging users to understand the implications of the Databrary [investigator agreement](http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.html).
- Users verify their provided email address.
- Users providing information about who (the institution or sponsoring researcher) will vouch for their access.

The registration wizard currently walks users through these steps in this order.
We are concerned with making this process as easy and transparent as possible.

# Splash

We aim to highlight recent progress made on the site with our splash page.
The page gives face-time to early adopters and features recent datasets uploaded by researchers.
Because we're still in the early stages of the project, there is too little data to show off much more of it on the splash page, but we are interested in alternative layouts that might bolster the achievements of Databrary and participating investigators.

For the duration of our beta, this splash page is visible only to authorized users, but this page will ultimately face the public.

# Volume

The basic unit of data on Databrary the volume, which can represent a dataset (raw, unanalyzed data collected for research) or a study (reflecting a research product, such as a publication).
Though the flesh and bone of volumes are raw, participant- and session-level videos, files, and analysis, we currently wish to focus on presentation of the following "top-level" metadata:

- Title: usually the same as the paper title, otherwise a descriptive summary
- Description: usually the same as the paper abstract, otherwise a longer description of acquisition methods, tasks, collection approach, etc.
- Citations: publications and other references associated with the volume's data
- Funding sources: agencies funding data collection and/or research, and grant numbers
- Access controls: permissions for sharing with the public, with Databrary users, with research labs, and with specified collaborators

We aim both to offer users this information clearly, but unobtrusively (as it is ultimately little more than the dust jacket of a volume), and also to make editing this information a fast and painless procedure.
We will explore the volume edit/creation wizard together with the hopes of clarifying terms and sharpening the workflow.
