Assisted Curation Requirements
==============================

- "I already have data and I'd like to upload it all now and tell you a little bit about it so that you can help me."
- One place to drop a large number of files.
- Files do get transcoded upon mass upload.
- Allow users to upload a spreadsheet of metadata that describes their sessions.
- Gathers the best person to contact for following up.

###Views

- Provided as an option after volume creation and before the volume design step.
- Is a separate tab with its own form for the user to fill out.
  - place to drop video files in bulk with guiding text.
  - place to upload a spreadsheet or other document that explains what's uploaded with guiding text.
  - Text field(s) for user to describe what they've uploaded.
  - Field for gathering user contact information.
  - Tells user that we will be in touch with them soon.
   

###Things to keep in mind

- Need to be careful that only the user who really need it will use it (risk that because it's an early option, many users will opt for this approach).
- What to do about damaged, corrupt, or odd formats that do not transcode?
- Might need to create more guidance for users to tell us more about their data (i.e., a single textarea might not be enough of a prompt).
- Users might not conceive of their data as sessions yet.
- Want to make sure that we get a contact for the most viable person to follow up with, may or may not be the person uploading to assisted curation.
- When do we have the conversation about consensts and whether the data will be shared or not?
