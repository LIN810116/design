Assisted Curation Requirements
==============================

## Simple staff review

- I wish Databrary staff to review and assist with my data (which I may upload own my own or get help with, below).
- I understand that Databrary staff may contact me with questions and/or reorganize my data for better presentation and sharing.

## Bulk upload

- "I already have data and I'd like to upload it all now and tell you a little bit about it so that you can help me."
- One place to drop a large number of files.
- Files do get transcoded upon mass upload.
- Allow users to upload a spreadsheet of metadata that describes their sessions.
- Gathers the best person to contact for following up.
  - at point of contact, probably if there's a person change they can let you know at that point

###Views

- Provided as an option after volume creation and before the volume design step.
- Is a separate tab with its own form for the user to fill out.
  - place to drop video files in bulk with guiding text.
  - place to upload a spreadsheet or other document that explains what's uploaded with guiding text.
  - Text field(s) for user to describe what they've uploaded.
   - Tells user that we will be in touch with them soon.
   

###Things to keep in mind

- Need to be careful that only the user who really need it will use it (risk that because it's an early option, many users will opt for this approach).
  - text right in the beginning to turn those users who don't need that help to something else
- What to do about damaged, corrupt, or odd formats that do not transcode?
  - provide a record of these files (as well as successfully uploaded files, for the user to address)
- Might need to create more guidance for users to tell us more about their data (i.e., a single textarea might not be enough of a prompt).
  - might be able to add a link to template ingest spreadsheet for reference. Though this might increase friction
- Users might not conceive of their data as sessions yet.
- Want to make sure that we get a contact for the most viable person to follow up with, may or may not be the person uploading to assisted curation.
- When do we have the conversation about consents and whether the data will be shared or not?
  - Make it clear to user that this is the start of a process, after upload, we will be in touch to get more details and schedule ingest
  - important to make sure there is intention to share - 1. intro text 2. a button to click before the upload section shows up where we can confirm 
- Make sure that users know that they cannot close the browser window during upload
  - pop up dialog 'navigating away from the page will cancel all ongoing uploads' when users try to close the browser
  - also a text warning somewhere near the upload section
