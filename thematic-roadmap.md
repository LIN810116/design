# Scheduled priorities, in order (requirements defined) for 1.3.1 and onward:

* 1. Sharing only volume-level metadata and highlights [1 month] 
	_"I want to only share descriptive information about a volume to help me fulfill NSF mandates for sharing and to showcase excerpts of the data that are being collected before I'm ready to share my entire dataset by treating all my sessions as private OR only displaying the top half of the volume"_

* 2. Modified front page design for authorized users [3 weeks] 
	_"I want more information about what I should and can do as an authorized user once I log in after being authorized."_	
	_"I want to see information on the front page that explains where I can find different things on Databrary, particularly information about where to find volumes that I have access to."_

* 3. Better display of views based on permission [2-3 weeks] 
	_"I want to see what parts of my volume are visible to Databrary users vs. to the public"_

* 4. Import/export of Datavyu files [3 months] 
	_"I want to download Datavyu files that match up correctly with the videos in the session and I want to be able to see how the Datavyu file is positioned on the timeline"_
