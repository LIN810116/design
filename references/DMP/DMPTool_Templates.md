DMPTool Templates for Relevant Funders
======================================

##Summary
Across four different DMPTool templates, these are the ones we need to be responsible for:

* Policies for access and sharing and appropriate protection and privacy NSF-CISE

 Explain how and when the data will become available. If there is an embargo period for sharing the data, make sure you provide details explaining this delay (e.g. publisher, political, commercial, patent reasons). And if the data is of a sensitive nature, address the means by which access will be restricted. Consider these questions:

    How will you make the data available?
    What resources are needed to access or use the data? Examples are software or equipment
    When will you make the data available?
    What is the process for gaining access to the data?
    How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before making them available for wider distribution?
    Are there any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent reasons? If so, give details.
    Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?
    Who will hold the intellectual property rights to the data and how might this affect data access?

* Data storage and preservation of access NSF-CISE/EHR/SBE

 Describe your long-term strategy for storing, archiving and preserving the data you will generate or use. Consider the following:

    What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?
    Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?
    What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?
    How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?
    What data will be preserved for the long-term?
    On what basis will data be selected for long-term preservation?
    What metadata/documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/transformation in order to make the data reusable?
    What related information will be deposited?

* Data format and dissemination NSF-EHR/SBE

 Describe the format of your data. Ideally, data formats will be chosen that are openly and freely available, and/or non-proprietary in nature. Consider the following:

    Which file formats will you use for your data, and why?
    What transformations (to more shareable formats) will be necessary to prepare data for preservation and data sharing?
    What form will the metadata take?
    How will you create or capture these details?
    Which metadata standards will you use and why have you chosen them? (e.g. accepted domain-local standards, widespread usage).
    What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?

 Describe how you will ensure dissemination of your data. Consider the following:

    How and when will you make the data available? (Include the resources needed to make the data available: equipment, systems, expertise, etc.)
    What other types of information should be shared regarding the data, e.g. the way it was generated, analytical and procedural, information?
    What is the process for gaining access to the data?
    Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?
    How will you manage data with sensitive information?
    Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?
    What have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol?

* Data sharing plan NIH

 The precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. Consider the following:

    When will you make the data available?
    What file formats will you use for your data, and why?
    What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation/data sharing?
    What metadata/documentation will be submitted alongside the data?
    Will a data-sharing agreement will be required? What will the agreement state?
    What are your plans for providing access to your data?
    Which archive/repository/central database have you identified as a place to deposit data?

###Roles and Responsibilities <span style="color:red;">**NO**</span>

 Explain how the responsibilities regarding the management of your data will be delegated.
