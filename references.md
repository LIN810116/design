Other products, technologies, or documents that may be worth investigating, using, or emulating.
If nothing else, a dumping ground for interesting things we should check out.

## Science Sites

* Obviously: journals
* [OSF](http://openscienceframework.org/project/4znZP/) provides a file repository, RCS features, tagging, wiki.  Under development, will be open sourced?
* [Dataverse](http://dvn-demo.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/) provides a site-deployable web site for sharing tabular data, highly structured representation of publications, data, analyses.  Open source.
* [Compcog Deep Tagging Project](http://www.cmdbase.org/) provides video sharing and tagging, primarily of non-human videos.

## Social Sites 

* Obviously: StackOverflow, github
* [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/home) is a public music exploration site that includes complex, implicitly derived item relationships, tagging, commenting, search, similarity, minimal curation, [APIs](http://www.last.fm/api), was once open-source but is no longer.
  Personally I think this is a well-done site that has added a lot of depth while keeping a fairly simple interface and is worth emulating.
* [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) at the other end of the spectrum is a music metadata site with highly complex metadata structure explicitly entered by users, moderation, APIs, fully open source.
  While this site is more satisfying from a database perspective, it scares many casual users off and has developed a wikipedia-like culture of perfectionist editors.
* [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) This is a desktop tool that has extraordinarily powerful metadata editing tools. They made it very easy to batch clean, repair and structure music metadata.

## Technologies

* Obviously: [DOI](http://www.doi.org)
* [OpenID](http://wiki.openid.net/w/page/12995211/OpenID_Authentication_2)
* [BrowserID](https://browserid.org/)
* [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) is an alternative to rails migrations that stays closer to SQL and thus provides full access to database features.
* [ResourceSync](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/) is a specification for a client-server synchronization framework based on [Sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org/).
