Order of UX Audit sections
==========================
**Problem areas**
* spreadsheet - develop user stories around editing metadata
* text on timeline
* "shared w/" information on study view page
* sitewide notifications for data and actions - crucial or sensitive areas should have clearer indications of who can see it and what certain actions will do (e.g. downloads on the latter).
* Session release levels are static, but confusing becuase user might think they are based on their personal access rights. Create summary for user that shows their access.
* Profile view is confusing, is the list of their studies for the user or for other users viewing that users profile. Both, but which is the priority? Is "My Volumes" a different view? Profile and Dashboard conflated?
