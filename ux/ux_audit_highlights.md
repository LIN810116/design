##Purpose: 
Improve user understanding of what they can and cannot do with using and downloading highlight assets.

###What users need to know: 

- They cannot (or can they) post highlights they've downloaded on social media (for example) (Do we need to open highlights up to the whole public?)
- That highlights are to be used for educational purposes only
- That this is only an excerpt of a video and not necessarily the whole thing
- ???

###Implementations:

- On download, popup that explains the 'terms of use'
- Put "highlight" in the file download name
- Add watermark to indicate excerpt/highlight (for down the road)
- Static site documentation on highlights and terms of use


###Other considerations:
- This may be tied to reminding the user more explicitly of what their site permissions are (and what this gets them access to)
- As per above, things like empty zip downloads may need to be technically modified or some message to the user that if they do not have access, the file will be empty.
