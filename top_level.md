## Top Level Volume Metadata

**Volumes can either be studies or datasets. Study metadata can be derived from publications and some of the metadata can be automatically populated when a PI links to their publication. Dataset metadata are driven by raw data and content should be written by the PI or a proxy**
***
# Datasets
Datasets only include raw data, and the metadata should reflect that.
***
## Titles
***
We need titles for the following

* dataset
* groups
* conditions
* tasks

### Formal Title

These titles should be descriptive, as they are what is displayed to the Databrary community. Titles should be clear enough that any user can get a general idea about the content. Formal titles should be concise and not so encumbered in information that they become unwieldy. A character limit of one-hundred is imposed.

 Before naming anything, a PI can ask themselves:
 
 **What are the most important aspects?**

* physical description
* specific population
	* age
	* demographic
	* geographical
	* gender
* display
* technique 
* location or setting

**What keywords would I use to find my own data?**

**Are the terms I am using sufficient for someone not in my lab but with similar expertise?** 

Titles should **not** include any analytical information or whys. Only hows and whats.

### Alias

These are short names used within a lab to manage their data. Aliases will only be viewable to the contributor(s), not by the rest of the Databrary community. 

## Descriptions
***
Descriptions of datasets should only summarize what happened in the sessions. These are short paragraphs with a character limit of 1024. When writing a summary, a PI should ask themselves:

**What was my collection methodology?**

**Who were my participants (age, gender, ability, demographic, ethnocultural, location etc)?**

**Where and/or in what setting did I collect my data?** 

**Did I split up my participants into different groups? How?**

**Did I split up my sessions into different conditions? What where they?**

**What did my participants do in each session? What is a general overview of the tasks?**

## Definitions
***
If there is more specific information than can be included in a dataset description, a PI can include a definitions document. These documents can further describe  each task, condition, group, exclusions and any other term that needs a more in-depth explanation than a dataset description can provide. Think of this as a glossary for the dataset.

## Images
***
These could be photos taken during the sessions or stills from a video. There should be at least one image associated with a dataset. Images of participants are identified data and Databrary will use the same consent information that was provided for the session the image is taken from. If the PI does not include an image, Databrary will take a representative still from one of their permissioned videos to display on the volume page.

## Materials
***
Any de-identified files that are created alongside or used with the data are materials. Materials can include:

### Stimuli

Images, videos or tests used in a session to evoke a response from a participant. As long as a PI is permissioned to share those stimuli, (i.e. there are not intellectual property conflicts and/or the PI created the stimuli themselves), a PI can share those stimuli as de-identified data.

### Protocols

Any document where a researcher writes up procedures of what happens in each session. These can be interview scripts or step-by-step instructions of how to conduct a a session or a task. 

### Methods

A formally written document describing data collection that can potentially be used in an article or publication. 

### Blank questionnaires

If the questionnaire was completed on camera, it can act as a partial transcript. 

### Blank consent forms

Not the Databrary form, but forms used for grandfathered data can be included to show what level of sharing  previous language permitted.

## Other organization questions for PIs
***
**What study or studies were derived from a dataset, if any?**

**Were multiple studies created using this same dataset?**

**Were complete sessions used in a study? Or were sessions broken up into different studies? What were they broken up by? Task? Condition?**

**Was a particular group or condition from this dataset used in a study?**

**Is this a longitudinal data?**
 
* Over what period of time was this data collected?
* At what intervals?
* Did the participant IDs stay the same?

# Studies
***

Studies represent papers, posters, publication or data that are going to be used for any sort of publication derived from a dataset or multiple datasets. If a PI ingests a publication (or, if there is no publication, a least a title and description) and a list of sessions from any dataset(s), Databrary can automatically create a study with minimal metadata.

***

## Titles and Descriptions

The title and the description can be the same as the title and abstract of a paper. If there is no paper or any similar publication, a PI can follow the dataset title and description guidelines.
***

## Images

Every study will need at least one image. Images can include graphs, slides from a presentation or any other image reflecting analyzed data as well as photos or stills from a video.
***

## Materials
In a study, materials are de-identified documents derived from analysis of raw data or tools used to analyze raw data. They can include **coding manuals** and **coding spreadsheets**.

***

## Publications
Studies can link to a correlating published paper. The PI can also include **ebooks**, **reference materials**, **posters**, **presentations** , **citations** or permissioned **videos of talks**.

## Funding

Grant information will need to be provided for each study.
