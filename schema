This is a high-level schema description representing logical data and
relationships.  These will not (necessarily) map to individual tables.

There is a SQL version of this in play/conf/evolutions/default/1.sql

Formatting suggestions welcome.  I'm just making things up for now and trying
to be consistent with syntax, but hopefully it's at least understandable.

See overview.md for descriptions.

Legend:
	Types (mostly postgres-like):
		id:		unique identifier primary key, most likely integer (implicit on all tables)
		long-text:	multi-line text, unlimited, possibly with some markup formatting?
		set:		shorthand for one-to-many table including current table's primary key and some unique constraints
	Keywords:
		user:		comes from the user by explicit prompting
		optional:	not required to be specified to allow submission
		public:		no restrictions except those inherited from containing objects
		internal:	never exposed to users
	'|':	subject to the following constraints
	':':	inherits from
	'--':	comment follows
