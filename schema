This is a high-level schema description representing logical data and
relationships.  These will not (necessarily) map to individual tables.

Formatting suggestions welcome.  I'm just making things up for now and trying
to be consistent with syntax, but hopefully it's at least understandable.

See overview.md for descriptions.

	Types (mostly postgres-like):
		id:		unique identifier primary key, most likely integer (implicit on all tables)
		long-text:	multi-line text, unlimited, possibly with some markup formatting?
