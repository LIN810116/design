# Databrary user interview 2015-10-23

Adolph lab, 2 postdocs, 1 graduate student
20-min feedback for recent features. only had one laptop to showcase. smaller screen (projector bad) is nicer as there seems to be less disconnect compared to a projector. ideally everyone had a laptop to fiddle around with features on their own. 

## Volume completion meter

* One user noted that completion % gives the feeling that items in the list were mandatory to complete. Other two disagreed, citing their own experience with Facebook and Linkedin, list gives them a sense of what is good for Databrary sharing.
    * solution might be to change wording from "complete" to something else. "improve" "better" "optimize"? "20% optimized"?

* All three users noted that listing steps of what to do in other pages was confusing. They didn't have any idea what the text was referring to, and it was hard to remember things to do anyway.
    * prompt steps with messages sticky on top, with an additional click from the user when they are done? users will have to manually click to go to next step once they are done on a page, but less uncertainty probably.
    * one user suggested links to tutorial videos/ user guide.

* One user noted header looked clickable due to circle with and without checks on the top-left corner, subtasks don't in contrast, due to lack of circle

## Volume spreadsheet filters, pivot table, and report creation

* All loved the idea of the features, and wanted to use, but none felt they were discoverable or self-learnable (none had experience with pivot tables) 
    * add instructions above pivot table
    * instructions show up for filters when there is 1 or less filters.

* unclear that certain filters could stack to create ranges

* none understood that the report management function applied to both currently set filters and generated summary.
