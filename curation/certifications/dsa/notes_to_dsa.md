Questions That Pertain to Completing the Data Seal of Approval 
==============================================================

- Do we have a mission statement around preservation practices for assets deposited in Databrary (Under whose authority (government, funding body, chief executive etc.))
- Are Databrary contributors only restricted to uploading data that they own? How do we confirm/enforce this if so?
- Approach to studies with insufficient metadata for long term preservation
- Do we have, or what would it take to draft, a crisis management plan. Is this something that already takes place on the storage side? Should we have one otherwise?
- What about licenses -> end user agreements
