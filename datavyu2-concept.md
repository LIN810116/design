## Databrary project

Databrary (databrary.org) is a free, web-based video library for researchers who study children’s learning and development. Databrary opened in 2014 and already houses thousands of hours of research video of children recorded in home and laboratory settings. As of October, 2015, more than 165 authorized researchers from 100 institutions in North and South America, Europe, and Asia have been granted access.

Video recordings are the backbone of developmental research. Databrary provides the tools and infrastructure for developmental researchers to reuse, explore, manage, store, analyze, and share research videos. By reusing and exploring shared videos, researchers can address questions outside the scope of the original study, see how to conduct research procedures, and find illustrative videos that improve the impact of their teaching. Databrary’s unique “upload-as-you-go” functionality enables easy and efficient data management and its centralized storage ensures secure backup and long-term video preservation.

Video has significant potential for reuse because it uniquely captures the complexity and richness of human behavior in ways human observers are readily able to understand and record. Researchers who collect video typically annotate it using specialized desktop software tools, spreadsheets, or pencil and paper. Scientists use both academic (Datavyu, Elan, Transana) and commercial tools (e.g., Noldus Observer, Mangold Interact) for video coding and annotation. But, since no standard scheme or file format exists, annotations made by one researcher cannot be readily shared with others. The lack of interoperability among coding tools limits the scientific impact of video data sharing.

## Improving The Quality, Transparency and Reproducibility of Video Annotations

Databrary seeks to accelerate the pace of discovery in developmental science and to improve scientific transparency. Improving video data coding and annotation practices is a vital part of achieving this goal. The Databrary team has already released a free, open-source, multi-platform video coding tool, Datayvu http://datavyu.org, online user guide http://datavyu.org/user-guide/, best practices paper http://datavyu.org/user-guide/best-practices.html. 
The team hosts an online user forum and provides hands-on support via workshops. But, because operating systems and hardware platforms continue to evolve rapidly, we believe that that the future of video coding is on the web.

We wish to develop a web-based video data coding tool that is embedded in the Databrary repository. We call the tool Datavyu 2.0. The tool would allow researchers to view videos at multiple playback speeds, code and annotate them using simple, easily learned keyboard commands. In this way, a researcher's Datavyu 2.0 codes are already and automatically stored in a consistent, structured way alongside the videos they've stored on Databrary. Datavyu 2.0 will encourage researchers to describe the relationship between simple alphanumeric codes entered at the keyboard and the meanings of those codes (e.g., 'm'= male or 'm'=moving) thereby creating reproducible and transparent coding manuals. Both the simple codes and coding manuals will provide data for Databrary's search engine. So, once the videos and Datavyu 2.0 codes are shared, they become available to the broader community of researchers, making it easier for data to be discovered and repurposed.

Future versions of Datavyu 2.0 could enable playback of multiple videos or the integration of other temporally dense data streams like eye tracking or physiological responses that are often collected by developmental researchers alongside video. We also envision Datavyu 2.0 serving as a catalyst for the incorporation of machine learning/computer vision analyses into the human video coding workflow.

The Databrary development team has conducted preliminary testing to determine the feasibility of building a real-time, interactive video coding application in the browser. Our tests suggest that modern browsers that fully implement HTML5 video player functionality can meet Datavyu 2.0's requirements. As a first step toward building Datavyu 2.0, the team has begun to plan for building software that will import video coding files from the academic and commercial tool vendors that provide non-proprietary file export formats. The team has also enabled simple video tagging/commenting functionality to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of web-based video annotation.

## Broader impacts

By creating infrastructure that allows researchers from around the world to upload, annotate, store, openly share, and reuse video, we will enable a broader and fuller understanding of child development. By maintaining video data in a structured repository on the web but bringing to the data poweful analytic tools, we will ensure consistency in data representation, transparency and reproducibility in the scientific process, and long-term preservation. This will ultimately save researchers both time and money.

## Programmatic needs for funding

Databrary seeks funding ($500K per year over a three-year period) to support the technical infrastructure and community building needed to build Datavyu 2.0. 

**Staff**: We envision needing two full-time developers and half-time effort from a support specialist who will conducts quality assurance testing and provide users with technical support.

**Storage and equipment**: Cyber-infrastructure is needed to support transcoding, storage, and retrieval of videos. We currently store 16 TB of video data and project storage needs to double or triple each year. 

**Workshops and community building**: We know from previous experience that in-person presentations and hands-on support are most productive for training researchers to analyze and reuse videos and for enabling video data sharing. Thus, we anticipate needing to hold workshops and training sessions.
