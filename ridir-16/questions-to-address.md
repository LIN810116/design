# Questions to address

### Science:

- What broad, important, fundamental research questions will be addressed?
- What research communities would be interested in exploring these questions?

### Information technology:

- What kinds of data are to be involved, including the metadata and the broader infrastructure in which data are embedded?
- How will the data be collected?
- If the database structures are novel (e.g., not a relational database), what would be their design?
- What analytic or statistical approaches will be provided to analyze the data?
- What infrastructure and financial support is required to ensure access to and long-term maintenance of these large scale data?

### Governance:

- How will the research communities involved in the project address governance as they relate to issues such as sustainability, access and ethical use of data relating to privacy and data confidentiality?

- How will issues such as interoperability and potential integration with existing resources be addressed?
  - Collaborating with HomeBank, LookIt?
