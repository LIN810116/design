Dear <CODING TOOL PROVIDER>,

As you may know, the Databrary digital library (databrary.org) was established with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to encourage researchers in the developmental and learning sciences to share video and audio recordings for scientific and educational purposes. We are writing to ask you to consider joining a new technical advisory committee charged with helping Databrary expand its functionality to meet the needs of a growing research community.

Since the library's opening almost two years ago, more than 230 authorized investigators from 148 institutions have created more than 160 data volumes representing more than 3,500 hours of recordings from more than 3,200 participants. These demonstrate that video and audio recordings and related metadata can be shared successfully among researchers. We believe that further  expanding data sharing will lead to accelerated data reuse and scientific discovery.

Toward that end, Databrary plans to submit a proposal to the NSF under the Resource Implementations for Data Intensive Research in the Social Behavioral and Economic Sciences (RIDIR) program (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15602/nsf15602.htm). The proposal focuses on enhancing Databrary so that it can import codes and annotations from the video and audio coding tools most commonly used among behavioral scientists, including <YOUR TOOL>. Doing so will allow users to search for keywords or codes across videos, and thus aggregate data across sources for future reanalysis. In addition, we plan to develop ways for Databrary's database of codes to be exported into a format that most, if not all, coding tools can readily import.

In addition, we plan to design interfaces for authorized Databrary users to share coding spreadsheets, maintain version control over coding information, and create electronic code manuals that link text-based or numeric tags to richer descriptions of code definitions, including video snippets or exemplars.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower researchers to search for, find, preview, and reuse video data collected by others by making it easy and convenient to search within videos for segments with specific tags or codes.

We wish to form a technical advisory committee that will advise the project's principal investigators and staff on the best ways to achieve these broad aims. We ask you to consider joining that advisory committee. If you are interested in discussing the possibility, please let us know right away so that we can schedule a time to brief you in greater detail about what will be involved.

We look forward to talking with you further,

Best wishes,

Rick O. Gilmore
