## Quotations from [program solicitation](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15602/nsf15602.htm)

>Databases which may be a new large scale database, a substantial expansion or revision of an extant database, or the merging of extant databases. Databases might include traditional relational data in digital form, collections of historical data, images, video recordings, administrative data/records or any other form of structured sets of data. The database must be accompanied by a usable interface that allows for the application of extant analytic tools or analytical tools that are developed as part of the project. Within this competition, the justification for the database rests on the potential it provides for enabling “data intensive SBE research”, which is amenable to utilization by substantial numbers of investigators. Central to the evaluation of proposals are the types, scope and potential significance of the research such a database would afford. For the purpose of this competition, data-intensive research is defined as research involving data resources that extend well beyond the storage requirements, computational intensiveness or complexity that is currently typical in SBE areas of research. Proposals should make clear how the proposed activities will enable promising SBE research that would not otherwise be possible. The investigations enabled by such data intensive research may be within or between any new or existing SBE field or fields. It may involve linkages between SBE science and other fields of science, although this is not required.
>Analytic tool(s) which would serve to enhance database use to address significant research questions within the SBE sciences. While a strong proposal would produce a tool of general utility it is required that the applicant link and discuss the tool within the context of a specific named database or set of databases. The tool must be made readily available to a broad research community at no more cost than is necessary to cover the expenses of its provision.

>Over the last three years, SBE has actively encouraged and supported communities to develop visions, teams, and capabilities dedicated to the creation of new, large-scale, next-generation data resources and relevant analytic techniques to advance fundamental research in the SBE sciences. This has been done both through the BCC-SBE/EHR competition and other mechanisms, such as Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). In 2015 SBE held the first RIDIR competition. This solicitation seeks to build upon those earlier efforts and describes a second and third year extension of the RIDIR competition.

## PROJECT SUMMARY

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Project Aims

1. Expand and extend Databrary's system for entering and visualizing user-defined video tags. Searching within videos for tags/codes.

**extends Databrary**, **user interface for use of analytic tools**, **enables data-intensive research by substantial number of investigators**, **enables research not otherwise possible**, **linkages with other areas of science**, **tools can be made readily available to research community**

2. Enable codes from some existing video coding tools to be imported into and visualized within Databrary.

a. Datavyu
b. ELAN
c. CLAN
d. Transana

Discuss feasibility with commercial providers (Noldus, Mangold).

3. Enable Databrary codes to be exported along with videos.

4. Develop data format for importing, representing, visualizing other temporally dense data streams.

5. Build tools for creating electronic code manuals within Databrary that link text-based tags to richer descriptions of code definitions, including video snippets, exemplars.

Steps toward community-defined ontologies.

6. Collaborative coding, sharing, version control.

### Background and Rationale

#### Why video?

- uniquely captures complexity of behavior
- cheap to collect, largely self-documenting
- widely used
- flexible, can be used in many contexts

#### How video enables behavioral science research

#### The Databrary digital library

#### Tools for analyzing video

- Tools allow text or numeric tags to be applied to segments of video by human observers.
- Transana as a model for free-form comments ...
- CLAN as a model for highly structured, strong regularized conceptual ontologies

#### Policy framework for sharing identifiable data

#### Gaps this project will fill

- Existing video coding tools are not interoperable with one another.
- Codes used by one research group cannot be compared to or built upon by other groups.
- Codes used by different research groups are poorly or inconsistently documented.
  - For example, some Databrary users upload detailed coding manuals, but not all, and formats are not readily searchable by others.
- Make Databrary more useful for a wider range of researchers.
- Enable search within videos, not just across them.

#### Research this project will enable

- Cross-disciplinary research where tags from one domain can inform research in others.
  - Example: Researcher interested in cognitive development can build upon tags provided by language researchers.
- Research that involves video + other temporally dense data streams (eye tracking, kinematics, physiology)
- Enhances value of existing resources on Databrary
- Illustration of dynamic modeling of time series a la Nilam Ram and the stillface group.

## Questions to address

### Science:

- What broad, important, fundamental research questions will be addressed?
- What research communities would be interested in exploring these questions?

### Information technology:

- What kinds of data are to be involved, including the metadata and the broader infrastructure in which data are embedded?
- How will the data be collected?
- If the database structures are novel (e.g., not a relational database), what would be their design?
- What analytic or statistical approaches will be provided to analyze the data?
- What infrastructure and financial support is required to ensure access to and long-term maintenance of these large scale data?

### Governance:

- How will the research communities involved in the project address governance as they relate to issues such as sustainability, access and ethical use of data relating to privacy and data confidentiality?

- How will issues such as interoperability and potential integration with existing resources be addressed?
  - Collaborating with HomeBank, LookIt?

## Supplementary documents

In addition to the supplementary documents required in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide, this section of the proposal must include two additional documents uploaded under Other Supplementary Docs. Although, at the Principal Investigator’s discretion these issues may also be discussed in the proposal’s Project Description, they must be directly addressed in the supplementary documents.

### Technical Plan:

A specific and detailed plan and technical details must be presented for how the project goals will be achieved. For example technicians, either by name or by competence/job qualifications should be identified; how will participating students be trained?; how would the broader research community be informed of the product and trained in its use? A detailed schedule with milestones should be included. (This list is not intended to be complete.) (page limit: 2 pages)

### Sustainability Plan:

How will the product be sustained after the expiry of the award? How will it be maintained and made accessible to the research community? (page limit: 1 page) Every project must include an estimate of its annual operational cost if it were to become fully operational.
