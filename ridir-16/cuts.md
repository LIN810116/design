More text available to Databrary search engine, the more relevant and powerful the searches can become.
Establishes framework for future extensions that would link to online (HTML-based) versions of published papers for data mining (e.g., neurosynth.org).
Further, Acknowledges growth in text-based data mining and analysis procedures.
Without access to text-based annotations of video segments, these tools can't yet be readily applied to video.

Behavior, thought, feeling, and communication unfold in real time.
No other measure captures the dynamics of behavior like video.
Video and before it, film, has formed the core of research in human development for decades.

- uniquely captures complexity of behavior
- cheap to collect, largely self-documenting
- widely used
- flexible, can be used in many contexts
- high reuse potential

Perhaps the most important challenge is cultural.
Community practices must change. Most researchers in the education, learning, and developmental sciences do not reuse their own videos or videos collected by other researchers; they neither recognize nor endorse the value of open sharing.
Contributing data is anathema and justifications against sharing are many. Researchers cite intellectual property and privacy issues, the lack of data sharing requirements from funding agencies, and fears about the misuse, misinterpretation, or professional harm that might come from sharing (Ascoli, 2006b; Ferguson, 2014).
Data sharing diverts energy and resources from scholarly activities that are more heavily and frequently rewarded. These barriers must be overcome to make video data sharing a scientific norm.

#### Project 1.4 Develop mechanisms for selecting and storing for later analysis found video segments.

(*I'm not sure any of this is in scope.*)

Once the search engine is able to find video segments and return them to the user in a way that enables browsing or previewing, we will need to develop a mechanism that allows users to select videos for subsequent detailed evaluation.
From the user's point of view, we envision an interface with checkboxes or similar functionality, possibly including filters that, for example, select the top 10 or 50 hits.
Then, we will need to create a workspace where a user can preview, comment upon,  and further evaluate the videos found in the prior search.
Workspaces will build on Databrary's existing "volume" functionality, where volumes are containers within which users can store groups of materials.
Workspaces, like volumes, will be linked to metadata like a project description, funding source, and have places to store materials like coding manuals, statistical analyses, etc.
The specific search and filter criteria will be stored so that these might be reused in the future.
Workspaces and volumes can be shared with other specific researchers a user selects or at some future date more widely.
We envision needing to modify Databrary's existing volume interface to indicate the source(s) of materials, and perhaps the search term(s) that generated the materials.
There will also need to be provisions in place to allow any annotations, comments, notes, or codes a user adds to materials "borrowed" from Databrary's shared videos to be linked back to the original sources.
A user who searches for videos meeting specific terms will not be required to share private annotations or codes, but those who do make their annotations or codes available will allow future searchers to benefit from the work of past searchers.
Also, users will be able to discard specific videos from a workspace or to delete a workspace if it is not longer in use.
Databrary's existing volume audit/tracking tools will be modified to allow users to review the history of their own workspaces/volumes.

Project 4.1 will focus on creating mechanisms that track data provenance -- segment HH:MM:SSS.mmm-HH:MM:SSS.mmm from video nnn from volume vvv and user uuu.

Other barriers to sharing coded videos exist.
Video contains identifiable information such as faces and voices, and so special care must be taken to secure permission from research participants before sharing videos outside of a research team.
The sensitive nature of video recordings and large file sizes pose technical challenges related to the location and capacity of video storage.
Varied video file formats, and the increasing availability of HD video formats pose additional challenges for storage and preservation.
Inconsistencies in representation and encoding of timing information between coding and video formats can confound interpretation, review, and collation of these codes.
Based on our recent community survey, the video-using developmental scientists use local file servers, cloud-based storage, and even email or snail mail to share videos and coded spreadsheets with colleagues outside their laboratories.
and the vast majority of researchers in these fields collect 5 to 10 or more hours of video per week (Gilmore & Adolph, 2016).

Data repositories from diverse areas of scholarly inquiry have begun to communicate with one another through groups such as the Research Data Alliance (https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/domain-repositories-interest-group.html) and work jointly to achieve common goals such as publishing author guidelines for transparent and open research (Nosek et al., 2015). New web-based platforms now enable open sharing of slides from talks (SlideShare -- http://www.slideshare.net), data, and materials (Figshare -- http://figshare.com; Open Science Framework -- http://osf.io; F1000 Research -- http://f1000research.com). The emergence of greater interest in open data sharing has coincided with the increasing popularity of web-based software sharing and version control systems such as GitHub (http://github.com), open source data analysis languages such as R (http://cran.r-project.org) and Python (https://www.python.org), and with the initiation of training programs such as Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org) that help working scientists acquire state-of-the-art data management skills. These initiatives seek to speed research progress, improve research practice, and foster greater scientific transparency.

Indeed, the development and application of new image analysis techniques from computer vision, focused on the automated indexing of large datasets of static images, have become a priority for the providers of large scale image and video databases (Google, Microsoft, Facebook).

Databrary will keep track of the source(s) of the selected videos and generate electronic "reference lists" of the materials a user searches for and copies (*maybe just for search results?*).

Educators, teacher trainers and evaluators use video to record what teachers do to help improve teaching practices or to evaluate performance (Bakken & Pierroux, 2015; Blomberg et al., 2013; Masats & Dooly, 2011; Baecher, Kung, Jewkes, & Rosalia, 2013).
Researchers use video in home and laboratory contexts to study how infants, children, and adults behave in natural or experimenter-imposed tasks (Karasik, Tamis-LeMonda, & Adolph, 2014).
Researchers record videos of students in classrooms (Alibali & Nathan, 2012) to understand what teachers do and how students respond.

To gain access to Databrary, a person must register  on the site. Applicants agree to uphold Databrary’s ethical principles and to follow accepted practices concerning the responsible use of sensitive data. Each applicant’s institution must co-sign an access agreement. Full privileges are granted only to those applicants with independent researcher status at their institutions. Others may be granted privileges if they are affiliated with a researcher who agrees to sponsor their application and to supervise their use. Ethics board or IRB approval is not required to gain access to Databrary because many use cases do not involve research. IRB approval is required to contribute data and for research uses. Once authorized, a user has full access to shared data on the site, and may browse, tag, download for later viewing, and conduct non- or pre-research activities.

In addition to restricting access to authorized researchers, Databrary has extended the principle of informed consent to participate in research to encompass permission to share data with other researchers. To formalize the process of acquiring permission, Databrary has developed a Participant Release Template (https://databrary.org/access/policies/release-template.html) with standard language recommended for use with study participants. This language helps participants to understand what is involved in sharing video data, with whom the data will be shared, and the potential risks of releasing video and other identifiable data to other researchers.

- Video and audio recordings contain identifiable information -- faces, voices, etc.
- Databrary has developed a policy framework that builds on the principles of informed consent.
- The framework allows research participants to give permission for their identifiable information to be shared with other researchers.
- The framework also allows research participants to give permission for excerpts or clips from their recordings to be shown for research or educational purposes.
- In turn, the framework limits access to the bulk of Databrary's materials to researchers who are specifically authorized by their institutions to have access to the library and to conduct research and non-research activities using these materials.

#### Building a Community

Data sharing works only when the scientific community embraces it. From the beginning, Databrary has sought to cultivate a community of researchers who support data sharing and commit to making sharing and reuse part of their work flows. Databrary's community building efforts involve many interacting components. These include active engagement with professional associations, conference-based exhibits and training workshops, communications with research ethics and administration staff, talks and presentations to diverse audiences, and one-on-one consultations with individual researchers and research teams. These activities are time and labor-intensive, they are critical to changing community attitudes toward data sharing in the educational and learning sciences. Looking ahead, it will be critical to engage funders, journals, and professional organizations in the effort to forge community consensus about the importance, feasibility, and potential of open video data sharing.
As it stands now, Databrary serves the community of researchers who study infant, child, and adolescent development, and the library is beginning to serve the needs of researchers who study K-12 education. However, the software is free and open source (http://github.com/databrary) and could readily be adapted for use by investigators interested in studying and sharing findings from research into best practices in engineering education or other fields.

Open data sharing can help to translate insights from scientific research into applications that serve essential human needs.
Open data sharing bolsters transparency and peer oversight (Miguel et al., 2014), encourages diversity of analysis and opinion, accelerates the education of new researchers, and stimulates the exploration of new topics not envisioned by the original investigators.
Data sharing and reuse increases the impact of public and private investments in research and promises to lead to more effective public policy.
The value of open data sharing has been known for decades (Perneger, 2011), but a vigorous open science movement has gained momentum only in recent years.
Open access journals now address general scientific topics (e.g., PeerJ -- https://peerj.com, PLOSOne -- http://www.plosone.org, and; GigaScience -- http://www.gigasciencejournal.com), specific domains (e.g., Advances in Engineering Education -- http://advances.asee.org and BMJ Open -- http://bmjopen.bmj.com/), and even raw data (e.g., Nature Scientific Data -- http://www.nature.com/sdata/).


Google, the owner of YouTube, has built an immense data infrastructure to upload, store, convert, tag, and stream video.

endow Databrary with the capability of storing, sharing, extracting, representing, and presenting to a diverse audience of users the information that is currently locked away in coding files with proprietary formats and idiosyncratically formatted coding manuals that are rarely shared.

ithin-video search depends upon
The project will in turn make the leading video coding tools more readily interoperable with one another.
This will make it
Since Databrary will serves as cloud storage for videos and as the "lingua franca" that connects coding files, video coders can be located anywhere.
The existing video coding tools capture project/dataset and video-level data and metadata in different ways.
Developing the capacity to import and export coding files in the major tool formats will reduce the barriers to sharing and reuse posed by incompatible formats.

The project will
For example, researchers who share interests in particular phenomena or constructs can search Databrary for illustrative video segments and have meaningful, data-driven discussions about whether the codes, definitions, and segments describe the same phenomenon.

There are a huge number of video formats; most coding tools struggle to support all of them.
The increasing use of HD video poses additional problems for tools that offer forward/backward video playback at high speeds.
A common complaint is that the timestamping provided by a coding tool can change depending on the format of the video.
By transcoding videos into a common, web-compatible format on Databrary, we will make it easier for users to choose the coding tool that suits their research requirements.
