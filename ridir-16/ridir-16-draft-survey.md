Dear Colleague,

The Databrary project (<http://databrary.org>) needs information about your video data collection and coding practices to make the library even more useful to a wider range of researchers. Please take 2-3 min of your time to complete this brief 8-question survey. It will help us immensely.

We will only share aggregate data, not individual responses.

With many thanks,

Karen Adolph & Rick Gilmore
