# Research questions

## Questions

- How many researchers use video, video coding tools?
  - What coding tools do researchers use?
- How many researchers who use video share videos and coding spreadsheets with researchers in another laboratory using i) email, ii) lab/department/university file servers, iii) cloud storage (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive)?
  - Do researchers who share videos use the _same_ coding tools?
    - If yes, how ensure data provenance, avoid overwriting files, naming consistency?
  - If not, how do the researchers share?
- How many researchers create coding manuals that contain definitions of codes?
  - What form do the coding manuals take (word processing documents, text files, wikis)?
- How are project/study/volume level metadata captured and stored?
- How are session level metadata captured and stored?
  - What is the format of existing spreadsheets?
- How do the leading tools export files?
  - Can the files be put into a simple format like timestamp, code?

## Implementation strategy

- Start with Databrary users.
- Post request on Datavyu help forum for people to give us emails.
- Commercial providers could provide lists of users, access to lists?
- Could send email to icis list, cds list. Ask respondents to provide email for more detailed survey later.
