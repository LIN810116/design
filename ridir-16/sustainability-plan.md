# Sustainability Plan

The first Databrary grant was funded by NSF in 2012, and current NIH funding runs through the spring of 2018.
NYU libraries have committed to preserving the data stored on Databrary indefinitely beyond the end of grant-related funding for the project.
We note that TalkBank, one of the most successful data repositories in the behavioral sciences, has been funded by competitive NIH and NSF grants for more than 30 years.
Accordingly, we see that continued grant-seeking remains the most viable and promising means of sustaining and building the Databrary library over the short to medium term.

The current proposal, if funded, would sustain Databrary through the fall of 2019.
We are planning new grant submissions to NICHD and to the Sloan and Gates Foundations, and we have other ideas enhancements to the library and research projects based on the library's holdings that we will target to NSF, NIH, and other Federal agencies.
The PIs have successful track records of seeking NSF and NIH funding, so we are optimistic about these prospects.

In the long term, we are working with NYU development staff to seek a private endowment fund for Databrary that would ensure resources for storage, maintenance, and development staff for an indefinite period.
We estimate that Databrary could be made fully self-supporting with an annual budget in the range of $300,000-350,000.

We continue to work with entities like ICSPR, TalkBank, and others to advocate for long-term, stable funding sources for data repositories.
Databrary is very early in its development, so we think that charging institutional or researcher-specific subscription fees is premature, but we note that the ArXiv PDF preprint repository has had success with a model mixing institutional contributions and core support from the host institution.
We do not think that advertising is appropriate to our mission, but we will continue to monitor the changing landscape of data repository funding, and make adjustments accordingly.
