## 2016-01-11

- ROG drafted [survey](ridir-16-draft-survey.md) and sent to Drew, Dylan, Carmen, and Karen for comments.
- ROG modified list of possible [technical advisory members](ridir-16-technical-adv-com.md). For this round, we will drop the eye tracking, EEG, and other experts to focus on video annotation. 
- On 2016-01-08, ROG and DS met. Agreed we need to evaluate Transana further before talking with developer.

## 2016-01-08

- ROG added to [proposal draft](ridr-16-ideas.md) some notes/thoughts.

## 2015-12-29

- ROG reordered aims. Make search 1, import codes 2, electronic code manuals 3, sharing/versioning 4.
- ROG emailed sales rep for Noldus (Mike Anzalone) and Mangold (Mike Guidi)

## 2015-12-28

- KEA and ROG agreed to drop aim associated with importing other time series.

    5. Work with experts from specific hardware and software communities to develop an open data format for importing, representing, and visualizing other temporally dense data streams within Databrary. Streams may include like those from eye/gaze-tracking systems, kinematic measurement systems, or physiological recording systems like electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin responses (GSR), or electroencephalography (EEG).

    Builds on Datavyu capabilities.
    Acknowledges that many developmental scientists collect one or more video streams along with other data.

    The other aims are more focused on search within videos.

- Discussed community research strategy. See [ridir-research-questions.md](ridir-research-questions.md)

- ROG wants to ask whether data mining of (HTML-based) manuscript text linked to datasets (a la neurosynth.org) makes sense for RIDIR or future project?
