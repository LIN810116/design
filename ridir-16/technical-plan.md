# Technical Plan

>A specific and detailed plan and technical details must be presented for how the project goals will be achieved. For example technicians, either by name or by competence/job qualifications should be identified; how will participating students be trained?; how would the broader research community be informed of the product and trained in its use? A detailed schedule with milestones should be included. (This list is not intended to be complete.) (page limit: 2 pages)
