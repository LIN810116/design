# Scope for evaluation tasks

To encourage deeper, more meaningful engagement by our targeted audience rather than broader engagement from serendipitous users. "Engagement" here is defined as users who actively use Databrary for their digital asset management or for the discovery of new material that bolsters their own work.

## Onboarding new users

- Task: Register
- Task: Request authorization (part of registration)
	- PIs request from institutions and affiliates request from PIs, but it's the same interface and the same process
- Task: Personalize profile
	- Add websites, affiliation, profile picture

## Search and discovery

- Task: Find a video clip of a child exploring objects that can be used in a talk or a lecture (i.e. the clip must be released for 'excerpts')

- Task: Search for volumes with a specific tag
- Task: For each of the volumes found above, note the original citation, funding source, volume description, and look at highlights. Download the Databrary citation in one of the formats.
