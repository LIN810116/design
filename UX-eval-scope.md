# Scope for evaluation tasks

To encourage deeper, more meaningful engagement by our primary users rather than broader engagement from serendipitous users. Primary users are those who actively use Databrary for their digital asset management or for the discovery of new material that bolsters their own work.

## Onboarding new users

** User goal: Register on Databrary, request authorization, and fill out personal profile in order to participate in the community more fully.**
* Note: the timing needs to be arranged such that someone from Databrary can approve the authorization instantly during the evaluation *

- Task: Register
	- Follow tabs on registration page to complete registration
	- If registering as Affiliate, request authorization from "Dylan Simon"
	- If registering as Authorized Investigator (PI), request authorization from "New York Univesity"
- Task: Personalize profile
	- Add websites, affiliation, profile picture

## Search and discovery

** User goal: Find data on Databrary that are relevant to my needs as a researcher **

- Task: Find a video clip of a child exhibiting 'scale error' that can be used in a talk or a lecture (i.e., the clip must be released for 'excerpts')
- Task: Search for volumes by a specific tag 
- Task: Find a volume with session metadata and videos
- Task: For the above volume, note the original citation, funding source, volume description, and look at highlights. Download the Databrary citation in one of the available formats
- Task: Exploring data from the above volume:
	- Go to a session and watch a video or videos
		- Add a tag to part of a video
	- Add a tag and a comment to the volume
	- Explore spreadsheet data by filtering
		- Filter by at least two fields (e.g. age, gender, race, condition)
		- Access NIH inclusion enrollment report (Researchers are federally required to submit enrollment reports on demographics every year. Databrary automatically generates enrollment reports for data you've uploaded.)
- Task: Download the following types of content
	- A single highlight
	- A session zip
	- Whole volume zip (Start the download but not necessary to complete as these zips can be rather large) 
	- Volume spreadsheet (CSV)

## Data management

** User goal: provide as much accurate metadata as possible and to do it so that other users can find and reuse data. **
* Note to evaluators: What is the experience switching between edit and view mode to review volume/session *
* Note: We will provide sample (dummy) data and files for these tasks of filling in volume and session metadata, including keywords *

- Task: Create volume and complete overview tab with basic information
	- Add volume keywords
- Task: Manage volume access	
	- Add collaborators (can use "Gladys Chan" and "Vicky Foo")
	- Give them read access and read-write access, respectively
- Task: Set up the study design using the preview spreadsheet as a guide
- Task: Find more information about organizing data on Databrary in the User guide
- Task: Create new session in spreadsheet and enter metadata
- Task: Upload files in a session
- Task: Position files in chronological order, and records (i.e., metadata associated with a specific file) accordingly in a session
- Task: Delete and undelete a file in a session
- Task: Replace a file in a session
- Task: Session history: Download the previous version of the file you just replaced
- Task: Volume history
	- Review the changes you've made in basic information
	- Review the changes you've made in access
- Task: Review the "volume completion meter" tab for anything else you can do on the volume
	- Follow instruction for creating a highlight from a session video file
- PI Task: Share the volume with the Databrary community

## Dashboard

**User goal: Quickly review and manage the volumes I am associated with. If I am a PI, I want to also manage my affiliates in one place.**

- Affiliate Task: View authorization(s) for who has sponsored you
- Affiliate Task: Find out what studies you have access to through your sponsor, and what level of access you have
- PI Task: Manage affiliates
	- Find out which affiliate is set to expire the soonest
	- Change the expiration to a month later
- PI Task: Review the volume you just created, note that it is shared, note your access level to the volume
