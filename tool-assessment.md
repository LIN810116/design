# Video annotation tool assessment

As a video-focused site, we need to understand the full range of available coding and annotation tools, both those we know about and those we don't.
This will inform a number of critical areas as we continue to develop Databrary:

- Understanding the range of existing video tools is critical to inform the kinds of features we can and may want to provide on the site.
  This is especially critical for the more qualitative annotation tools, as they allow more flexible rearrangement and presentation of video data that may be useful for user-provided collections, discussion, and content.
- Knowing how users typically analyze and code their data will inform development of any future coding tools and allow us to provide functionality sufficiently powerful and familiar to our target and potential users.
- Being able to import data from range of tools employed by our users will provide more value to these existing data, allowing for richer search, discovery, and exploration features by incorporating existing annotations.
- Allowing export of data in various forms will allow users to incorporate Databrary data into their existing workflows.

We need to use existing resources to assess offerings and features of available packages.
With guidance from Dylan and Lisa, feedback from Gladys, and oversight from Karen, Drew and Vicky are best positioned to identify the primary purpose and functionality of each of the different tools.

Lisa and Dylan will first understand the core components of each tool and describe:

Audience: Who uses the tool?
Purpose: What kind of research is it designed for and primarily used for?

Drew and Vicky will then understand the tools in detail.

Drew will investigate:
- Overall scope of encompassed and recorded data: what defines a "project", "session", "pass", "item", "code", etc.
- The basic file structure: how do the above map into saved file(s)
- Language, vocabulary, terminology used by the tool
- The structure (schema) of the analysis data: to what extent this is commensurate or compatible with other tools, and how we could represent this structure

Vicky will assess each tool talking to expert users and watching them code (likely with Lisa) and then using it extensively for relevant types of coding that the tool is built for. Lisa and Dylan will provide guidance about the types of coding that is done with each tool and sample coding schemas she should try when using each tool.

Vicky will understand and document:
- The range of functionality the tool provides
- Analysis features of each tool, and workflow from annotation to analysis.
- Determine how portably and how well each works (platforms, responsiveness, stability, video support)

The team will develop an evolving rubric to describe each tool along various dimensions.
