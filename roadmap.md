# PROJECT CHARTER

## Purpose of document

This document defines Databrary's strategic aims, mission, and scope.

## Background

<!--general description, including problems the project is trying to solve, key goals & deliverables-->
*Databrary is a tool built for researchers and is focused on accommodating the needs of researchers.* 

- Strategic alignment (with agency/university goals)


## Mission

Our mission is to promote sharing and reuse of video data.
Enabling reuse of video data is essential to increasing openness, maximizing the efficiency of limited resources, and accelerating the pace of discovery in the developmental and learning sciences. 

We aim to provide tools that encourage good data management, facilitate open data sharing, enable discovery, and foster data reuse and integration.
We are working to build functionality that allows researchers to organize, store, code, and share identifiable video data and other contextual information about the videos with other researchers through a secure web-based library.



* streamline research workflow into one system (not entirely possible)
* for whose benefit?: Researchers who collect and use video recordings as data
* why video? We focus on video data because: 
	- problem no one else is solving
	- higher potential for reuse
	- identifiability concerns are important but solvable 
	- lowers barrier to entry relative other data types & formats

### Objectives

To accomplish this mission, Databrary has five core aims:

- Build a community of researchers committed to sharing video data
- Create a policy environment to enable sharing of identifiable data among researchers
- Build a repository for storing, managing, and sharing video data and metadata
- Enhance tools for coding video
- Build tools for data management
	- Data management facilitates sharing and reuse

## Values(?)

- Community driven: our approach is to build functionality and tools that suit the specific needs and use cases of our community of active users, based on what the community tells us they need.
Adjusting data model as new requirements and data structures arise

- Responsive: we seek to constantly refine and expand (functionality, features) based on feedback from our community.

- Supportive: at every turn, we work to minimize transaction costs for our community, and provide any assistance and education that we can.


## Scope

Our focus is on <!--what is the right action word here: organizing, managing, understanding, visualizing, ..., ? --> raw temporal data formats--such as audio and video recordings--which are generally coded by hand as well as the coding data that is added to it.

Thus, our target audience is researchers who collect and/or use video and audio recordings. Often these recordings are the backbone of their research.

We are building tools for managing ongoing studies with their lab and collaborators, tagging and coding data, sharing data with a trusted group of responsible researchers, and discovering new sources of data to repurpose for new questions.

# PROJECT PLAN

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define key project deliverables and priorities, articulate project dependencies and identifies an internal schedule and roadmap.

The Project Plan forms the 'contract' between the project team and organizational and project management. 

- Project roles
- Broad deliverables, goals
- Interfaces
- Work breakdown structure
- Dependencies and constraints
- Schedule (see master.mpp)

## Project management approach

As an extended project with a number of complexities, unknowns, and uncertainties it's important to that the broad mission, scope, objectives, and high-level schedule are transparent among project leadership, well-managed, and clearly communicated to stakeholders. 
This will be managed by the maintenance of a Project Charter, Project Plan and Schedule (roadmap), guided by an advisory board with stakeholder representation to provide regular feedback about priorities and direction.
The schedule will be managed using project management software (AtTask, Microsoft Project, or Project Libre).
Software development and detailed project components will be managed using work management and ticket tracking systems such as Open Project.

## Roles
## Key Deliverables & Goals

1. Functional spreadsheet

Goal: Let researchers enter their study metadata in an online format that is clear, comprehensible and flexible enough to suit their study design

1. Ability to arrange videos and other study related files in time

Goal: Let researchers drag and drop videos and other files on a timeline viewer in order to indicate temporal relations between files. 

1. Adding annotations and tags, comments 

Goal: Let researchers annotate sections of videos or other files with tags and comments about the videos. This includes general comments or tags about videos that they are simply browsing and exploring. 

1. Importing and visualizing existing codes

Goal: To display coding data created in other software tools on Databrary in line with the videos.

1. Coding videos online

Goal: Let researchers code video files online. 

1. Find interesting videos 

Goal: Let researchers search, sort, and filter for studies, videos, or clips in order to discover content that is interesting and relevant.
