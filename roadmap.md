# PROJECT PLAN

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define key project deliverables and priorities, articulate project dependencies and identifies an internal schedule and dependencies.

The Project Plan forms the 'contract' between the project team and organizational and project management. 

- Broad deliverables, goals
- Interfaces
- Work breakdown structure
- Dependencies and constraints
- Schedule (see master.mpp)

## Key Deliverables & Goals

### Functional spreadsheet

Goal: Let researchers enter their study metadata in an online format that is clear, comprehensible and flexible enough to suit their study design

### Ability to arrange videos and other study related files in time

Goal: Let researchers drag and drop videos and other files on a timeline viewer in order to indicate temporal relations between files. 

### Adding annotations and tags, comments 

Goal: Let researchers annotate sections of videos or other files with tags and comments about the videos. This includes general comments or tags about videos that they are simply browsing and exploring. 

### Importing and visualizing existing codes

Goal: To display coding data created in other software tools on Databrary in line with the videos.

### Coding videos online

Goal: Let researchers code video files online. 

### Find interesting videos 

Goal: Let researchers search, sort, and filter for studies, videos, or clips in order to discover content that is interesting and relevant.

# PROJECT CHARTER

## Purpose 

<!--(of charter)-->
This document is a quick way to define the project's mission and approach, and is intended to elicit feedback on key project aspects.

The Project Charter is the basis of the more detailed Project Plan, which identifies internal schedule and dependencies. The Project Plan forms the 'contract' between the project team and organizational and project management. 

The purpose of this document is to lay out...

- project management approach



## Background

<!--general description, including problems the project is trying to solve, key goals & deliverables-->

## Project definition

- Vision

*Databrary is a tool for researchers and  built to accommodate the needs of researchers. We want to build tools that suit the specific needs and use cases of our community, based on what the community tells us they need. (Adjusting data model as new data structures arise)*


- Mission statement

Behavior is incredibly rich, and video offers the promise of potentially unlimited uses of the behaviors that are captured.Databrary's mission is to enable researchers that use video and audio data as a backbone of their research to organize, store, and share video data and other supporting information about the raw video. Video is our primary focus as it has widespread use in developmental science. 

- Scope

Raw, temporal data that users generally code by hand

- Objective

AIMS OF PROJECT, KEY STRATEGY(IES) FOR ACCOMPLISHING AIMS

- Strategic alignment (with agency/university goals)
- Constraints
- Assumptions
- Scope 
- Key stakeholders
	- Users
	- Partners
	- Advisers & other contributors
	- Funders
- Governance structures
- Roles
- Risks
- Project management approach
	- 	As an extended project with a number of complexities, unknowns, and uncertainties it's important to that the broad mission, scope, objectives, and high-level schedule are transparent among project leadership, well-managed, and clearly communicated to stakeholders. 
	- 	This will be managed by the maintenance of a project charter, project plan and schedule(roadmap), advisory board with stakeholder representation to provide regular feedback about priorities and direction.
		- 	These will be managed in documents and project management software (AtTask, Microsoft Project, or Project Libre).
		- 	Software development and detailed project components will be managed using work management and ticket tracking systems such as Open Project.
