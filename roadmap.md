# Roadmap

## Mission statement

Databrary's mission is to enable developmental scientists to manage, store, and share video data and other supporting information **about** the raw video. Video is our primary focus because it has widespread use in developmental science. Behavior is incredibly rich, and video offers the promise of potentially unlimited uses of the behaviors that are captured. 

Databrary focuses on the following functional areas to provide maximally useful features to researchers using the site.

### Functional spreadsheet

Goal: Let researchers enter their study metadata in an online format that is clear, comprehensible and flexible enough to suit their study design

### Ability to arrange videos and other study related files in time

Goal: Let researchers drag and drop videos and other files on a timeline viewer in order to indicate temporal relations between files. 

### Adding annotations and tags, comments 

Goal: Let researchers annotate sections of videos or other files with tags and comments about the videos. This includes general comments or tags about videos that they are simply browsing and exploring. 

### Importing and visualizing existing codes

Goal: To display coding data created in other software tools on Databrary in line with the videos.

### Coding videos online

Goal: Let researchers code video files online. 

### Find interesting videos 

Goal: Let researchers search, sort, and filter for studies, videos, or clips in order to discover content that is interesting and relevant.
