Databrary background for UX Department heuristic evaluation

# Description of Databrary

Databrary is a web-accessible, video data repository for researchers in the behavioural and learning sciences. It allows researchers to store, manage, and share the video they collect through the course of their studies. It also allows them to attach metadata and supplementary documents to these videos to help with data management in their lab and for sharing with colleagues.

Databrary currently supports two types of adding data: 1) after-the-fact ingestion by Databrary staff and 2) allowing users to upload their videos and metadata as they conduct their study. The web application is largely geared for the latter, and is built with the intent of making this process more intiutive and similar to their existing local workflows.

Because video data of human subjects are sensitive, highly customizable access levels for the data users contribute are central to the functionality of Databrary. Users can choose from four different access levels (private, share with authorized Databrary users only, share with authorized Databrary users only adding the ability to use of video excerpts in educational settings, and public) to specify with whom and how they share their data. Because of this, who can read from and write to Databrary depends on a users role. 


#Primary User Roles

There are two primary users of Databrary. The first are Principle Investigators (PIs), who are identified on Databrary as Authorized Investigators. The second are Lab members, who are identified on Databrary as Affiliates.

###PIs (Authorized Investigators)

Authorized Investigators are the Databrary users that must be authorized by their institution to contribute and share data on Databrary. They are generally considered to be the lead on a study and also to be the data owner for a volume (which is the representation of a study or dataset on Databrary). They have full read/write permissions for a volume and are the only users who can actually share the volume with the rest of the Databrary community once ready to do so.

While it is not a hard and fast rule, we have noticed that PIs are generally responsible for creating and describing the volume and establishing the study design, which consists of selecting the categories and fields that make up the important metadata for their volume. Normally, they are not the parties that will be uploading videos and metadata to Databrary. Lab members who work for the PI will usually undertake these tasks.

The amount and nature of work a PI does on Databrary is potentially determined by whether they are junior or senior. Junior PIs are usually more newly minted faculty and may have higher fluency with new technical workflows. Senior PIs have more experience as investgators and may have less incentive in their day to day operations to learn new technical workflows. We have tried to make Databrary usable for both parties.

###Lab members (Affiliates)

PIs sponsor members of their lab to participate and assist in contributing data to Databrary. We anticipate that much of the day to day work of uploading files and adding and managing metadata will be conducted by Affiliates. Affiliates tend to be undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or full-time staff or lab managers. Their traditional roles in the lab are to collect and organize data, use desktop software to annotate videos that will help them analyze the data they collect, and handle other day to day operations of the lab. On Databrary, it will be their responsibility to take data and metadata from the labs local context and put it onto Databrary using the spreadsheet metadata viewer/editor and timeline interface, which depicts a single row of the spreadsheet view.
